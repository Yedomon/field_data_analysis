> To cross-validate the results of NIRS scanning, the 70 samples with sufficient seeds were subjected to chemical determination. Approximately 10 g of cleaned seed samples were manually ground to fine powder with liquid nitrogen. Seed oil was estimated by the conventional Soxhlet method using petroleum ether as extraction solvent [13]. Total protein content was determined by the Kjeldahl method according to AOAC [14]. Determination of oleic and linoleic acids was performed following Stefanoudaki et al. [15]. Each sample was tested in triplicate.

Raw data of each location were checked for outliers and tested for normality. The statistical analysis was performed following a one-step approach. Adjusted entry means were calculated based on the performance of the parents, controls, and hybrids using the following model across six environments:



   ![eq1](https://github.com/Yedomon/field_data_analysis/blob/main/equation1.PNG?raw=true)






where yijkl is the observed phenotype; µ represents the general mean; gi refers to the effect of the ith genotype; ej refers to the effect of the jth environment; (g×e)ij is the interaction effect between genotype i and environment j; rjk is the effect of the kth replication in the jth environment; bjkl is the effect of lth block nested in the kth replication of jth environment; and εijkl is the residual effect. For the estimation of entry means, the genotypic effects were considered fixed and all other effects were random. For the variance component estimation, all effects were regarded as random (Piepho et al. 2003). Broad-sense heritability (H2 ) for all 13 agronomic traits was calculated
across environments, using the following formula,
